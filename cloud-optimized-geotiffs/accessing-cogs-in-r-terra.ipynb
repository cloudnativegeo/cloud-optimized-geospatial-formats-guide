    "## Accessing Data in Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) with `terra` in R\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) are a specialized format of GeoTIFF designed to enable efficient access to raster data, particularly in cloud environments. By organizing data into tiled structures and enabling partial reads, COGs allow users to fetch only the portions they need, significantly reducing bandwidth and storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how `terra` interacts with COGs and how aligning data requests with internal tile boundaries improves performance. While it is generally unnecessary to think about tiling explicitly, understanding how COGs structure data can help in designing efficient workflows. Another option for accessing cogs in in R is the `stars` package, for which another version of this notebook is available [here](./accessing-cogs-in-r-stars.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using COGs provides significant advantages over traditional GeoTIFFs with minimal additional effort. As such, when writing raster data in GeoTIFF format, it is best practice to produce valid COGs whenever possible. For more details on how to generate COGs, see the  [guide on writing COGs with python](./writing-cogs-in-python.html).\n",

    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- **COGs allow for selective data access**, reducing bandwidth use and improving efficiency.\n",
    "- **Aligning requests with internal tile grids** minimizes redundant reads and speeds up workflows.\n",
    "- **Even when misaligned, COGs are significantly more efficient** than traditional GeoTIFFs due to their internal organization.\n",
    "- **Using `terra` provides an intuitive way to work with COGs**, leveraging R’s geospatial ecosystem.\n",

    "### Review of Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored how to efficiently access and process geospatial data stored in a Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) using `terra` in R. The key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficient Data Access:\n",
    "- COGs allow on-demand access to specific regions of a dataset without requiring the download of the entire file.\n",
    "- This capability minimizes bandwidth usage, accelerates workflows, and supports scalable analysis of large geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualization of Internal Tiling:\n",
    "- We visualized the internal tile structure of the COG (1024x1024 tiles) by overlaying a grid on the raster. \n",
    "- A blue rectangle highlighted the region corresponding to the first tile, illustrating how COGs organize data into blocks for efficient access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aligned and Unaligned Access:\n",
    "1. **Aligned Access**:\n",
    "   - A 1024x1024 region corresponding to the first tile (top-left corner) was extracted.\n",
    "   - This represents the best-case scenario for COGs, where the requested region aligns perfectly with an internal tile, ensuring minimal data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unaligned Access**:\n",
    "   - A 1024x1024 region spanning portions of 4 tiles was extracted.\n",
    "   - This less-optimal case demonstrates how misalignment with the internal tile grid increases the amount of data accessed while still avoiding the need to download the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection on Tools:\n",
    "- The `terra` package provides a powerful and flexible interface for geospatial data processing in R, enabling tasks such as cropping, visualizing, and analyzing raster data.\n",
    "- By leveraging COG-specific features like internal tiling and on-demand access, workflows can be made more efficient and cost-effective."
